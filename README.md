## Database Schema

The system uses SQLite with three main tables:

- **purchases**: Purchase entries with calculated due dates and status
- **payments**: Payment records linked to purchases

## Key Features Explained

### Auto-Calculation Logic
- **Due Date**: Bill Date + Credit Days
- **Pending Amount**: Bill Amount - Advance Paid
- **Status**: Based on pending amount and due date
- **Days Remaining**: Due Date - Today's Date

### Status Categories
- **Paid**: Pending amount ‚â§ 0
- **Overdue**: Pending amount > 0 AND days remaining < 0
- **Due Today**: Pending amount > 0 AND days remaining = 0
- **Due Soon**: Pending amount > 0 AND 0 < days remaining ‚â§ 7
- **Pending**: Pending amount > 0 AND days remaining > 7

## Customization

### Change Reminder Window
Modify the reminder window (default 7 days) in the dashboard:
```python
# In app.py, line ~150
remind_window_days = 7  # Change this value
```

### Add New Payment Methods
Edit the payment method options in `templates/purchases.html`:
```html
<option value="New Method">New Method</option>
```
